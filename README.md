I am an ontology developer and recently graduated from the University at Buffalo, where I studied the philosophy of applied ontology with Dr. Barry Smith and Dr. John Beverly.
On this page you can find projects I have built to demonstrate my skills with Python, Protege, and other data/ontology development tools.








ZEBRA PUZZLE:
The 'Zebra Puzzle' is a logical puzzle supposedly created by Albert Einstein. The set-up is that within each of five houses is an occupant who smokes a particular brand of cigatettes, drinks a particular drink, and owns a particular pet. Based off a list of clues, you can infer where the 'zebra' is located among five houses, even though it is never mentioned in the clues.
The clues are:
1. The Englishman lives in the Red house.
2. The Spaniard owns the Dog.
3. Coffee is drunk in the Green house.
4. The Ukrainian drinks Tea.
5. The Green house is immediately to the right of the Ivory house.
6. The Old Gold smoker owns Snails.
7. Kools are smoked in the Yellow house.
8. Milk is drunk in the middle house.
9. The Norwegian lives in the first house.
10. The man who smokes Chesterfields lives in the house next to the man with the Fox.
11. Kools are smoked in the house next to the house where the Horse is kept.
12. The Lucky Strike smoker drinks Orange juice.
13. The Japanese smokes Parliaments.
14. The Norwegian lives next to the Blue house.
By describing the relations in an ontology, we can infer where the zebra must be, and a work-in-rogress Owl file can be found in this repository attempting to do that.
