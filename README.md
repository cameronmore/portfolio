# Portfolio

I am an ontology developer and recently graduated from the University at Buffalo, where I studied the philosophy of applied ontology with Dr. Barry Smith and Dr. John Beverly.

## Navigating This GitHub

In this repository, you can find projects I have built to demonstrate my skills with Python, Protege, and other data/ontology development tools. My other repositories include my work on the STEM Identity Ontology (STEMIO), the Mental Functioning Ontology (MFO), and an Unconscious Extension of MFO. Below, I describe the files that can be found in this personal portfolio.

### 1. Zebra Puzzle

The Zebra Puzzle is a logical puzzle, supposedly invented by Albert Einstein. From a series of clues, one is able to infer the location of a zebra among five distinctly colored houses. Each house has its own occupant, pet, cigarette brand, and drink. To solve the puzzle, I built an ontology that describes the classes of things (occupants, houses, colors, etc), and asserted the relationships between the classes (all occupants occupy houses) and the particular relations (the clues below). By running a reasoner on the ontology, we can infer the location of the zebra. The Owl file can be found in this repo. I have listed the clues below:

```
1. The Englishman lives in the Red house.
2. The Spaniard owns the Dog.
3. Coffee is drunk in the Green house.
4. The Ukrainian drinks Tea.
5. The Green house is immediately to the right of the Ivory house.
6. The Old Gold smoker owns Snails.
7. Kools are smoked in the Yellow house.
8. Milk is drunk in the middle house.
9. The Norwegian lives in the first house.
10. The man who smokes Chesterfields lives in the house next to the man with the Fox.
11. Kools are smoked in the house next to the house where the Horse is kept.
12. The Lucky Strike smoker drinks Orange juice.
13. The Japanese smokes Parliaments.
14. The Norwegian lives next to the Blue house.

### 2. Unconscious Extension of the Mental Fnctioning Ontology

I have attached a copy of a paper that outlines the current goals and deliverables that an unconscious extension of the mental functioning ontology can achieve.
